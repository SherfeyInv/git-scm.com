meaningless and giving either of them results in an error.  The

specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by
using <span class='synopsis'><code>--ours</code></span> or <span class='synopsis'><code>--theirs</code></span>.  With <span class='synopsis'><code>-m</code></span>, changes made to the working tree

This would tell us to use "hack" as the local branch when branching
off of "origin/hack" (or "remotes/origin/hack", or even
"refs/remotes/origin/hack").  If the given name has no slash, or the above
guessing results in an empty name, the guessing is aborted.  You can

new branch will have no parents and it will be the root of a new
history totally disconnected from all the other branches and
commits.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run
"git checkout &lt;start_point&gt;".  This allows you to start a new history

"git commit -a" to make the root commit.</p>

an open source branch of a project whose current tree is "clean", but

code.</p>

<p>If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of paths
that is totally different from the one of &lt;start_point&gt;, then you should
clear the index and the working tree right after creating the orphan
branch by running "git rm -rf ." from the top level of the working tree.
Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files, repopulating the
working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p>

branch, your working tree contents, and the new branch
is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>

<p>If you have an unfortunate branch that is named <span class='synopsis'><code>hello.c</code></span>, this

<p>However, your "wrong" branch and correct "mytopic" branch may

the above checkout would fail like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ git checkout mytopic
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching branches.</pre>

<pre>$ git checkout -m mytopic

<p>After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <em>not</em>

<p>When a merge conflict happens during switching branches with

<p>At this point, <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>diff</code></span> shows the changes cleanly merged as in
