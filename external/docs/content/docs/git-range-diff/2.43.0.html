<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command shows the differences between two versions of a patch
series, or more generally, two commit ranges (ignoring merge commits).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the presence of <span class='synopsis'><em>&lt;path&gt;</em></span> arguments, these commit ranges are limited
accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To that end, it first finds pairs of commits from both commit ranges
that correspond with each other. Two commits are said to correspond when
the diff between their patches (i.e. the author information, the commit
message and the commit diff) is reasonably small compared to the
patches' size. See ``Algorithm`` below for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the list of matching commits is shown in the order of the
second commit range, with unmatched commits being inserted just after
all of their ancestors have been shown.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three ways to specify the commit ranges:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class='synopsis'><em>&lt;range1&gt;</em> <em>&lt;range2&gt;</em></span>: Either commit range can be of the form

<p>When the commit diffs differ, <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>range-diff</code></span> recreates the
original diffs' coloring, and adds outer -/+ diff markers with
the <strong>background</strong> being red/green to make it easier to see e.g.
when there was a change in what exact lines were added.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the commit diff lines that are only present in the first commit
range are shown "dimmed" (this can be overridden using the <span class='synopsis'><code>color.diff.</code><em>&lt;slot&gt;</em></span>
config setting where <span class='synopsis'><em>&lt;slot&gt;</em></span> is one of <span class='synopsis'><code>contextDimmed</code></span>, <span class='synopsis'><code>oldDimmed</code></span> and
<span class='synopsis'><code>newDimmed</code></span>), and the commit diff lines that are only present in the second
commit range are shown in bold (which can be overridden using the config

<p><span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>range-diff</code></span> also accepts the regular diff options (see

<span class='synopsis'><code>--no-color</code></span> options. These options are used when generating the "diff
between patches", i.e. to compare the author, commit message and diff of
corresponding old/new commits. There is currently no means to tweak most of the
diff options passed to <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>log</code></span> when generating those patches.</p>

<h2 id="_output_stability"><a class="anchor" href="#_output_stability"></a>OUTPUT STABILITY</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output of the <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span> command is subject to change. It is
intended to be human-readable porcelain output, not something that can
be used across versions of Git to get a textually stable <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span>
(as opposed to something like the <span class='synopsis'><code>--stable</code></span> option to
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-patch-id" >}}'>git-patch-id[1]</a>). There&#8217;s also no equivalent of
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-apply" >}}'>git-apply[1]</a> for <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span>, the output is not intended to
be machine-readable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is particularly true when passing in diff options. Currently some
options like <span class='synopsis'><code>--stat</code></span> can, as an emergent effect, produce output
that&#8217;s quite useless in the context of <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span>. Future versions
of <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span> may learn to interpret such options in a manner
specific to <span class='synopsis'><code>range-diff</code></span> (e.g. for <span class='synopsis'><code>--stat</code></span> producing human-readable
output which summarizes how the diffstat changed).</p>

<p>In this example, there are 3 old and 3 new commits, where the developer
removed the 3rd, added a new one before the first two, and modified the
commit message of the 2nd commit as well as its diff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the output goes to a terminal, it is color-coded by default, just
like regular <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>diff</code></span>'s output. In addition, the first line (adding a
commit) is green, the last line (deleting a commit) is red, the second
line (with a perfect match) is yellow like the commit header of <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code>

<code>show</code></span>'s output, and the third line colors the old commit red, the new
one green and the rest like <span class='synopsis'><code>git</code> <code>show</code></span>'s commit header.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A naive color-coded diff of diffs is actually a bit hard to read,
though, as it colors the entire lines red or green. The line that added
"What is unexpected" in the old commit, for example, is completely red,
even if the intent of the old commit was to add something.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help with that, <span class='synopsis'><code>range</code></span> uses the <span class='synopsis'><code>--dual-color</code></span> mode by default. In
this mode, the diff of diffs will retain the original diff colors, and
prefix the lines with -/+ markers that have their <strong>background</strong> red or
green, to make it more obvious that they describe how the diff itself
changed.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_algorithm"><a class="anchor" href="#_algorithm"></a>Algorithm</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general idea is this: we generate a cost matrix between the commits
in both commit ranges, then solve the least-cost assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost matrix is populated thusly: for each pair of commits, both
diffs are generated and the "diff of diffs" is generated, with 3 context
lines, then the number of lines in that diff is used as cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid false positives (e.g. when a patch has been removed, and an
unrelated patch has been added between two iterations of the same patch
series), the cost matrix is extended to allow for that, by adding
fixed-cost entries for wholesale deletes/adds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Example: Let commits <span class='synopsis'><code>1--2</code></span> be the first iteration of a patch series and
<span class='synopsis'><code>A--C</code></span> the second iteration. Let&#8217;s assume that <span class='synopsis'><code>A</code></span> is a cherry-pick of
<span class='synopsis'><code>2,</code></span> and <span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span> is a cherry-pick of <span class='synopsis'><code>1</code></span> but with a small modification (say,
a fixed typo). Visualize the commits as a bipartite graph:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    1            A

    2            B

		 C</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are looking for a "best" explanation of the new series in terms of
the old one. We can represent an "explanation" as an edge in the graph:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    1            A
	       /
    2 --------'  B

		 C</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This explanation comes for "free" because there was no change. Similarly
<span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span> could be explained using <span class='synopsis'><code>1</code></span>, but that comes at some cost c&gt;0
because of the modification:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    1 ----.      A
	  |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
	  |
	  `----- C
	  c&gt;0</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In mathematical terms, what we are looking for is some sort of a minimum
cost bipartite matching; <span class='synopsis'><code>1</code></span> is matched to <span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span> at some cost, etc. The
underlying graph is in fact a complete bipartite graph; the cost we
associate with every edge is the size of the diff between the two
commits' patches. To explain also new commits, we introduce dummy nodes
on both sides:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    1 ----.      A
	  |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
	  |
    o     `----- C
	  c&gt;0
    o            o

    o            o</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cost of an edge <span class='synopsis'><code>o--C</code></span> is the size of <span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span>'s diff, modified by a
fudge factor that should be smaller than 100%. The cost of an edge
<span class='synopsis'><code>o--o</code></span> is free. The fudge factor is necessary because even if <span class='synopsis'><code>1</code></span> and
<span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span> have nothing in common, they may still share a few empty lines and
such, possibly making the assignment <span class='synopsis'><code>1--C</code></span>, <span class='synopsis'><code>o--o</code></span> slightly cheaper
than <span class='synopsis'><code>1--o</code></span>, <span class='synopsis'><code>o--C</code></span> even if <span class='synopsis'><code>1</code></span> and <span class='synopsis'><code>C</code></span> have nothing in common. With the
fudge factor we require a much larger common part to consider patches as
corresponding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overall time needed to compute this algorithm is the time needed to
compute n+m commit diffs and then n*m diffs of patches, plus the time
needed to compute the least-cost assignment between n and m diffs. Git
uses an implementation of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve the
assignment problem, which has cubic runtime complexity. The matching
found in this case will look like this:</p>
