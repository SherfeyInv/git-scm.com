<p>The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch
or pull operation.  This parameter can be either a URL
(see the section <a href="#URLS">GIT URLS</a> below) or the name
of a remote (see the section <a href="#REMOTES">REMOTES</a> below).</p>

<dd>
<p>A name referring to a list of repositories as the value
of remotes.&lt;group&gt; in the configuration file.
(See <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-config" >}}'>git-config[1]</a>).</p>

<dd>
<p>Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update.
When no &lt;refspec&gt;s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch
are read from <span class='synopsis'><code>remote.</code><em>&lt;repository&gt;</em><code>.fetch</code></span> variables instead
(see <a href="#CRTB">CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES</a> below).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
<span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span>, followed by the source &lt;src&gt;, followed
by a colon <span class='synopsis'><code>:</code></span>, followed by the destination &lt;dst&gt;.
The colon can be omitted when &lt;dst&gt; is empty.  &lt;src&gt; is
typically a ref, or a glob pattern with a single <span class='synopsis'><code>*</code></span> that is used
to match a set of refs, but it can also be a fully spelled hex object
name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A &lt;refspec&gt; may contain a <span class='synopsis'><code>*</code></span> in its &lt;src&gt; to indicate a simple pattern
match. Such a refspec functions like a glob that matches any ref with the
pattern. A pattern &lt;refspec&gt; must have one and only one <span class='synopsis'><code>*</code></span> in both the &lt;src&gt; and
&lt;dst&gt;. It will map refs to the destination by replacing the <span class='synopsis'><code>*</code></span> with the
contents matched from the source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a refspec is prefixed by <span class='synopsis'><code>^</code></span>, it will be interpreted as a negative
refspec. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local refs to
update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude. A ref will be
considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does
not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict
the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific refs.
Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs. However, they may only
contain a &lt;src&gt; and do not specify a &lt;dst&gt;. Fully spelled out hex object
names are also not supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class='synopsis'><code>tag</code> <em>&lt;tag&gt;</em></span> means the same as <span class='synopsis'><code>refs/tags/</code><em>&lt;tag&gt;</em><code>:refs/tags/</code><em>&lt;tag&gt;</em></span>;
it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt;
is fetched, and if &lt;dst&gt; is not an empty string, an attempt
is made to update the local ref that matches it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether that update is allowed without <span class='synopsis'><code>--force</code></span> depends on the ref
namespace it&#8217;s being fetched to, the type of object being fetched, and
whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward. Generally, the
same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the <span class='synopsis'><em>&lt;refspec&gt;</em>...</span>
section of <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a> for what those are. Exceptions to those
rules particular to <em>git fetch</em> are noted below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with
<a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a>, any updates to <span class='synopsis'><code>refs/tags/*</code></span> would be accepted
without <span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span> in the refspec (or <span class='synopsis'><code>--force</code></span>). When fetching, we promiscuously
considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches.  Since
Git version 2.20, fetching to update <span class='synopsis'><code>refs/tags/*</code></span> works the same way
as when pushing. I.e. any updates will be rejected without <span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span> in the
refspec (or <span class='synopsis'><code>--force</code></span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike when pushing with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a>, any updates outside of
<span class='synopsis'><code>refs/{tags,heads}/*</code></span> will be accepted without <span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span> in the refspec (or
<span class='synopsis'><code>--force</code></span>), whether that&#8217;s swapping e.g. a tree object for a blob, or
a commit for another commit that doesn&#8217;t have the previous commit as
an ancestor etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike when pushing with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a>, there is no
configuration which&#8217;ll amend these rules, and nothing like a
<span class='synopsis'><code>pre-fetch</code></span> hook analogous to the <span class='synopsis'><code>pre-receive</code></span> hook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with pushing with <a href='{{< relurl "docs/git-push" >}}'>git-push[1]</a>, all of the rules described
above about what&#8217;s not allowed as an update can be overridden by
adding an optional leading <span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span> to a refspec (or using the <span class='synopsis'><code>--force</code></span>
command line option). The only exception to this is that no amount of
forcing will make the <span class='synopsis'><code>refs/heads/*</code></span> namespace accept a non-commit
object.</p>

When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to
be rewound and rebased regularly, it is expected that
its new tip will not be a descendant of its previous tip
(as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time
you fetched).  You would want
to use the <span class='synopsis'><code>+</code></span> sign to indicate non-fast-forward updates
will be needed for such branches.  There is no way to
determine or declare that a branch will be made available
in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user simply
must know this is the expected usage pattern for a branch.
